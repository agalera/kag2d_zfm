# Using Mods in KAG

## Joining a Modded Server

Simply join the server and accept the mod download.
Everything should compile and work "out of the box" with no fiddling with files!
If you have trouble, try clearing out your mods folder and restarting your KAG; you might have an incompatible version.

## Downloading mods directly

For offline play, you need to download the mod directly into your KAG folder.
Put the mod folder inside {KAG}/Mods - do not put the mod files directly inside the mods folder, it will not work.
Add folder names to {KAG}/mods.cfg to use each specific mod. This lets you turn mods on and off without deleting or moving them.

## Hosting mods

Say you want to add bunnies on your server.

- Go to this thread (https://forum.kag2d.com/threads/king-arthurs-armory.15559/) and download the bunny rabbit mod by Skinney from the modding forums.
- Unpack the bunny into {KAG}/Mods/Bunny
- Open {KAG}/mods.cfg and add the line Bunny at the bottom of the file
- Start your dedicated server
- Spawn bunnies into the server with the chat command !bunny
- When people join your server, they will automatically download the mod

## Making mods

Modding Discussion is on #modding on the Official Discord - the link is in-game.
Posting mods to the forums as resources helps other people find and share your mod!
Hosting mods on your own server can also help people easily play it.

Testing your mod locally in singleplayer:
1. Make a Sandbox mode by copying Sandbox rules to your mod folder and run Sandbox through the main menu.
2. If you're making a new gamemode don't forget to change: sv_gamemode = YourNewGameMode in autoconfig.cfg
and then launch with params: KAG.exe noautoupdate nolauncher autostart Scripts/localhost.as
