This file contains known but unlikely to be fixed issues with the modding system.
We'll include workarounds where possible.
---------------------------------------------------------
- soft file matcher doesn't work on files in Mods/ eg. PlaySound("WaterSplash")
	workaround: use the full path to the file

- scripts not in .cfg files will not be synced (added only with AddScript)
	workaround: include all the scripts and remove the ones you dont want, or 
				have a "dummy" config file that includes all the missing scripts.

- ConfigFile cfg("somefile") - doesn't use the filematcher
	workaround: use cfg.loadFile("somefile") instead

- files included with #include "filename" dont work from mods, it uses the
	one in base/ preferentially.
	workaround: include mods for the files that are supposed to be using a new
				include, and change the name of the included file to something
				that's not in base (like filename_modded or filename_yourmodname)
